          {parabens && <div>
            <strong>Parabens</strong>: Lorraine Massey cautions against these in the curly hair <a href="https://amzn.to/2Y0pqDb">Handbook</a> saying "In recent years, theyâ€™ve become controversial as experts question whether they are safe. (Some say they may be linked to cancer.)" We recommend we do your own research.
            </div> }

            {witch && <div>
              <strong>Witch Hazel</strong>: Most types of witch hazel contain alcohol. Contact the manufacturer to see if the witch hazel in this product contains alcohol. Even if it does not contain alcohol, many people find witch hazel drying. Use with caution if you have hair prone to dryness.
              </div> }


            {soap && <div>
              <strong>Is this soap?</strong>. <br />
              This product contains at least one of the following which could mean it has soap:
              <br />
              <ul>
              <ResultListing list={others.soaps.sort()}/>
              </ul>

              We recommend doing more research and contacting the manufacturer to find out. Soap is as harsh as sulfates. In addition many soap products are not properly pH balanced which can further damage hair. Check out our <Link to="/shampoo-bars-are-not-cg/" className="btn btn-secondary">article on soap</Link> for more info. <a href="http://m.me/curlsbot">If you don't think this contains soap, please message me and let me know.</a>
